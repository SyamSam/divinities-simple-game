# divinities-simple-game
This is my project that I was building a game with some of my friends helping me out with mapping.

This application uses a Unity Game Engine and run by C++ programming language. It is used mostly for just a project in my university so I decided to just put here as a way for me to remember that I did this work too.

The controls in this game are:
Arrow Keys (Keyboard)- Movement
X Button (Keyboard) - Attack
Spacebar (Keyboard) - Jump

There are only one type of enemy in the game because I didn't have time to add more type of enemies.
There are also health potions to get too if you are on low HP.

Thank you for reading this.
